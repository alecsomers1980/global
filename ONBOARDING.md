# Onboarding Checklist

Welcome to the team! Perform these steps to get your environment ready.

## Phase 1: Environment Setup
- [ ] Clone the repository from the central Git server (e.g., GitHub).
- [ ] Install Node.js dependencies (`npm install`) in the active project directory.
- [ ] Configure your personal Stitch MCP credentials.
- [ ] Create a local `.env.local` file with required API keys (ask your colleague for the values).
- [ ] Verify you can run a local dev server (`npm run dev`).

## Phase 2: Understanding the Agency
- [ ] Read the root **[README.md](file:///c:/Users/info/OneDrive/Documents/Antigravity/README.md)**.
- [ ] Review the **[Collaboration Guide](file:///c:/Users/info/OneDrive/Documents/Antigravity/COLLABORATION.md)**.
- [ ] Browse the **[Design System](file:///c:/Users/info/OneDrive/Documents/Antigravity/DESIGN.md)** to understand our visual identity.

## Phase 3: First Task
- [ ] Pick a minor issue or feature.
- [ ] Use the `stitch-loop` skill to generate initial UI.
- [ ] Submit your changes via PR for review.
