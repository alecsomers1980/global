# Antigravity Agency — Operating Model & Standards

This document serves as the **Primary Directive** for all Antigravity projects. It defines the business model, operational standards, and the monthly innovation cycle.

---

## 🏗️ 1. The SaaS Business Model (Agency Ownership)
**"I build it, I own it, you use it."**

- **IP Ownership:** All systems, custom code, and AI pipelines designed by Antigravity remain the property of the Developer.
- **Service-Based Access:** Clients do not "buy" the website; they subscribe to the **Antigravity Business Platform**.
- **Termination Clause:** If the monthly service fee is discontinued, access to the platform, admin panels, and custom automations is revoked.
- **Data Portability:** Clients own their *data* (leads, customer info, sales logs), but the *engine* that processes that data belongs to the agency.

---

## 🛡️ 2. Core Operational Standards
These are non-negotiable standards applied to every project.

### Data Security & Privacy (POPIA / GDPR)
- **Top of Mind:** Encryption at rest and in transit for all sensitive data.
- **Role-Based Access (RBAC):** Strict separation of Admin, Affiliate, and Client data.
- **Zero-Password Policy:** Prioritize Magic Links or SSO to reduce credential theft risk.

### Backups & Resilience
- **Automated Backups:** Daily database and storage backups via Supabase/Vercel.
- **System Monitoring:** Built-in health checks for AI pipelines (detecting failures in Gemini/Fal.ai calls).
- **Incident Response:** Automated alerts if the site or a critical API route goes down.

## 💰 3. Financial Blueprint: Costing vs. Pricing

| Category | Our Cost (Developer) | Client Pricing (Aloe/Everest/RVR) |
|----------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Infrastructure** | API/Hosting pass-through | ~3x Markup (Platform Fee) |
| **Development** | R&D Time | Implementation Fee (Value-Based) |
| **New Features** | Proof of Concept Time | Add-on Implementation + Recurring bump |

---

## 🔄 4. The Monthly Innovation Cycle
On the **1st of every month**, a "Project Intelligence Report" is generated for the Designer (You) containing:

1. **New Ideas:** 3 fresh automation or feature ideas based on current market trends.
2. **Implementation Time:** Realistic sprint estimates.
3. **Cost Estimate:** Breakdown of API/Infrastructure increase vs. potential Revenue for the client.
4. **Performance Check:** Summary of "how things are running" (uptime, lead volume, AI success rates).

## 📝 5. Memory Directive
**Agent Instruction:** Whenever a new project starts or a status update is requested, reference this document to ensure the **Antigravity Agency Operating Model** is being enforced. Every proposal must include:
1. "How it helps the business" (ROI for client)
2. "Cost to run" (Cost for agency)
3. "Monthly Service Fee" (SaaS revenue)
