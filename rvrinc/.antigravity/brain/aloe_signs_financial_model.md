## 🔒 The SaaS Ownership Strategy
1. **Developer Ownership:** You maintain all admin rights to the infrastructure.
2. **Subscription Access:** If the client defaults on the service fee, the "Auto-Design Engine" and "Field Capture App" are logically disabled.
3. **Managed Evolution:** Part of the monthly fee includes the "Project Intelligence Report" (Monthly) where you pitch the next Tier or a feature upgrade.

*Note: All ZAR values are suggested benchmarks based on the high operational value provided to a signage business.*
