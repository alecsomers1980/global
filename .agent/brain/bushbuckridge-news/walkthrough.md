# Bushbuckridge News - Frontend Implementation

I have successfully initialized the new Next.js project and built the primary user interface adhering to the strict **Cinematic Landing Page Builder** guidelines from the provided `GEMINI.md` file.

The application is currently running locally.

## Hero Section
Implemented the "Organic Tech" preset with a heavy primary-to-black gradient overlay, large typography contrasting bold sans with massive italic drama fonts, and GSAP staggered entrance animations.

## Interactive Features ("Information Instrument")
Built the three requested feature cards (Diagnostic Shuffler, Telemetry Typewriter, and Cursor Protocol Scheduler) adapted for a local news context: **Live Reporting**, **Unfiltered Insights**, and **Community Pulse**.

## What's Next?
Once you approve this visual direction and aesthetic foundation, we will connect the Supabase Headless CMS and execute the script to port over all your 2025+ WordPress posts!
