# Walkthrough: Doing Business in Bushbuckridge

The foundational build of the **Bushbuckridge Business Journal & Directory** is complete. We have moved from a WordPress-dependent concept to a high-performance, custom-built Next.js and Supabase application.

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Business Directory
A searchable, filterable directory of local businesses.
*   **Intelligent Sorting:** Featured businesses appear first, followed by Premium, Enhanced, and Standard tiers.
*   **Service Finder:** A dedicated search mode for users looking for a *service* (e.g., "plumber") rather than a specific business name.
*   **Direct Contact:** Integrated WhatsApp and Call buttons on every listing for immediate lead generation.

### 2. Content Archives
Full publication suite for regional news and opportunities:
*   **Spotlight:** Editorial-style business profiles with dedicated detail pages.
*   **Events:** Upcoming regional events with dates and venues.
*   **Opportunities:** Tenders, training, and funding listings with deadline tracking.
*   **Jobs:** Local employment opportunities archive.

### 3. Lead Capture & CRM (Offline Sales Model)
Instead of automated checkout, the site captures high-intent leads for the sales team:
*   **"Buy Your Spot" Form:** Securely captures business details and requested packages.
*   **Annual Journal Gate:** Captures email addresses before providing the PDF download link.
*   **Staff Admin Portal:** A secure dashboard where staff can review leads, verify payments, and approve directory listings with one click.

## 🛠 Technical Highlights
*   **Next.js 15 (App Router):** Utilizing the latest server-side rendering for maximum SEO and speed.
*   **Supabase Backend:** Robust PostgreSQL database with built-in authentication and Row Level Security.
*   **Shadcn/UI:** Premium, custom-styled components using the modern "Doing Business" aesthetic.
*   **Mobile-First Design:** Fully responsive layout optimized for users on the go in the Bushbuckridge region.
