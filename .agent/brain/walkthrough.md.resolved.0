# Aloe Signs Cinematic UI Redesign Walkthrough

The Aloe Signs website has been transformed into a premium, professional, and cinematic experience. The redesign focuses on high-impact visuals, sophisticated typography (Outfit and Manrope), and a sleek "Cinematic Black" theme with vibrant emerald accents.

## [x] Accomplishments

### 1. Cinematic Design Foundation
- **Dark Mode Architecture**: Implemented a core palette of `Cinematic Black (#0B0E0D)` and `Vibrant Emerald (#4ADE80)`.
- **Typography Overhaul**: Switched to **Outfit** for bold headings and **Manrope** for legible, modern body text.
- **Glassmorphism System**: Added `.glass-card` and `.glass-header` utilities for depth and premium feel.

### 2. Immersive Homepage Experience
- **Hero Banner**: A full-bleed, cinematic workshop background with dynamic vignette overlays and bold Outfit typography.
- **Floating Navigation**: A glassmorphism-based header that adapts to scroll and provides a modern, high-tech interface.
- **Service Cards**: Refactored services into interactive glass cards with hover-to-reveal color effects and smooth transitions.
- **Portfolio Showcase**: Restructured the image grid into a premium, rounded-corner collage with hover depth.
