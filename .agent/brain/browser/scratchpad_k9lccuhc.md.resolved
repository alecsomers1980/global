# Findings
- URL: http://localhost:3001
- Port: 3001
- Issue: The browser tool is unable to maintain any open pages. Every `open_browser_url` call returns a success but subsequent `list_browser_pages`, `read_browser_page`, or `capture_browser_screenshot` calls fail with "page not found" or "Browser may not be initialized".
- Conclusion: Unable to verify the site visually or capture the requested screenshot due to technical environment limitations.
