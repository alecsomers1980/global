# Aloe Signs Cinematic UI Verification

## Task Checklist
- [X] Open `http://localhost:3001` (Attempted multiple times, browser sessions are failing immediately)
- [ ] Verify floating header
- [ ] Verify cinematic hero section with background image
- [ ] Verify Services section
- [ ] Verify Image Grid section
- [ ] Capture full-page screenshot
- [ ] Summarize findings

## Notes
- Port: 3001
- Target: Cinematic look and feel
- Key components to check: Header, Hero, Services, Image Grid.
- **Troubleshooting**: 
    - Encounted repeated "page not found" errors immediately after successfully calling `open_browser_url`.
    - `list_browser_pages` returns "No active pages found" even after `open_browser_url` returns a successful `page_id`.
    - Tried `localhost:3001`, `google.com`, `wikipedia.org`, and `about:blank` - all failed with the same behavior.
    - Queued operations (open + screenshot) also failed.
    - Resizing the window failed with "page not found".
    - **Conclusion**: The browser environment is currently unable to maintain any active pages. This is likely a system-level issue beyond the agent's control. Visual verification cannot be performed at this time.
