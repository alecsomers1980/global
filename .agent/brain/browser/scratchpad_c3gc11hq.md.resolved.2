# Aloe Signs Cinematic UI Verification

## Task Checklist
- [X] Open `http://localhost:3001` (Attempted multiple times, browser sessions are failing immediately)
- [ ] Verify floating header
- [ ] Verify cinematic hero section with background image
- [ ] Verify Services section
- [ ] Verify Image Grid section
- [ ] Capture full-page screenshot
- [ ] Summarize findings

## Notes
- Port: 3001
- Target: Cinematic look and feel
- Key components to check: Header, Hero, Services, Image Grid.
- **Troubleshooting**: 
    - Encounted repeated "page not found" errors immediately after successfully calling `open_browser_url`.
    - `list_browser_pages` returns "No active pages found" even after `open_browser_url` returns a successful `page_id`.
    - This behavior is consistent for both `localhost:3001` and `google.com`.
    - This indicates a platform-level browser environment issue where pages are closed or lost immediately after creation.
    - Cannot proceed with visual verification or screenshots until browser stability is restored.
