# Aloe Signs Cinematic UI Verification

## Task Checklist
- [/] Open `http://localhost:3001` (Attempted, encountering browser stability issues)
- [ ] Verify floating header
- [ ] Verify cinematic hero section with background image
- [ ] Verify Services section
- [ ] Verify Image Grid section
- [ ] Capture full-page screenshot
- [ ] Summarize findings

## Notes
- Port: 3001
- Target: Cinematic look and feel
- Key components to check: Header, Hero, Services, Image Grid.
- **Troubleshooting**: Encounted "page not found" errors when trying to read DOM or take screenshots of both localhost and google.com. This suggests a browser environment issue. Will attempt to list pages and use `read_browser_page` immediately after opening.
