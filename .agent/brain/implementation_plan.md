# Business Strategy: Ember Automation

This plan outlines the setup for **Ember Automation**, a SaaS-style agency focused on rebuilding websites and automating business processes for clients across South Africa.

## 🏷️ Brand Name: Ember Automation
*   **Theme**: Fire (connects to Fire Wire IT).
*   **Depth**: "Fan into flame the gift of God" (2 Timothy 1:6).
*   **Vibe**: Reliable, lasting, and transformative.

## 🎨 Visual Identity
- **Colors**: 
    - **Primary**: Ember Orange (#FF4D00) - Represents energy and the flame.
    - **Secondary**: Deep Charcoal (#1A1A1A) - Represents the solid foundation/coal.
    - **Accent**: Soft Gold (#FFD700) - Represents the "refining" process and premium quality.
- **Logo Concept**: 
    - A stylized, minimalist ember (a small glowing diamond or flame shape) contained within a hexagonal or circular gear (automation).
    - The typography should be bold and professional (e.g., `Inter` Medium or `Montserrat`).
- **Typography**: 
    - **Headings**: `Outfit` (Modern, geometric, tech-focused).
    - **Body**: `Inter` (Clean, highly legible, professional).

## Proposed Service Tiers (Monthly SaaS Model)
Clients pay $0 setup and a monthly fee.

- **Special Rate**: 40% discount on the monthly fee.
- **Updates**: Free system updates for life (excluding external API costs).

## 💎 Value Proposition
"**Ember Automation** doesn't just build websites; we fuel your business engine. We fan the small sparks of your potential into a roaring flame through precision automation, modern design, and niche-specific systems that improve accuracy and speed to completion."

## Legal & Compliance (South Africa)
1. **POPIA Compliance**:
    - Every client system MUST have a Data Processing Agreement (DPA).
    - Appoint an Information Officer (you or a designate).
    - Implement "Privacy by Design" in all automations.
2. **Copyright & Ownership**:
    - **Contract Clause**: "The Company retains ownership of the underlying software architecture and custom code. The Client retains ownership of all content, data, and business-specific intellectual property."
    - This allows you to improve your core SaaS systems using learnings/data while protecting the client's information.
3. **ECTA & CPA**:
    - Use clear, plain-language digital contracts for the SaaS subscription.
    - Include a simple "opt-out" clause for the subscription (e.g., 30-day notice).

## Verification Plan
### Review Cycle
1. **Consultation**: Present these ideas to you (User) for feedback.
2. **Refinement**: Adjust pricing and naming based on your preference.
3. **MVP Launch**: Build your own agency website based on the chosen brand.

### Manual Verification
1. Review name availability (CIPC/Domains).
2. Validate pricing against local competitors (Wix/Local Agencies vs. high-end custom dev).
