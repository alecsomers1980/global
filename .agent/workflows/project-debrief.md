# Agency Project Debrief Protocol

Run this workflow at the end of every client website project to extract learnings and improve the agency's AI intelligence.

## 1. Extract Project Learnings
Review the completed project and document the following in a Knowledge Item (KI):
- **Industry/Niche**: What was the client's industry?
- **Winning Layouts**: Which sections worked best or looked the most premium?
- **SEO Tactics**: What specific keyword structures or schema patterns were used?
- **Conversion Triggers**: What was the main CTA and why was it effective?
- **Challenges**: What objections or technical hurdles did we overcome?

## 2. Update the Component Library
Identify at least 1-2 high-quality UI components from this project (e.g., a great Hero section, a unique Service Grid) and copy them into the `Component-Library/` repository for future reuse.

## 3. Refine Master Prompts
Based on this project, do we need to update the `/new-client-site` workflow? (e.g., Did we learn a new accessibility rule, or a better way to structure CSS?) If so, update the master workflow.

## 4. Final KI Generation
Synthesize these findings into a permanent Markdown KI in the knowledge system to inform all future builds in this industry.
